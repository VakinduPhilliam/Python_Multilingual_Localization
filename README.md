# Python_Multilingual_Localization
The following scripts are written to demonstrate the process of multilingual Application localization using the ‘gettext’ Python module, an API for Multilingual internationalization services. The gettext module provides internationalization (I18N) and localization (L10N) services for your Python modules and applications.  It supports both the GNU gettext message catalog API and a higher level, class-based API that may be more appropriate for Python files.  The interfaces described allow you to write your module and application messages in one natural language, and provide a catalog of translated messages for running under different natural languages.  The Python ‘gettext’ API module defines an API, which is very similar to the GNU gettext API.  If you use this API you will affect the translation of your entire application globally.  Often this is what you want if your application is monolingual, with the choice of language dependent on the locale of your user.  If you are localizing a Python module, or if your application needs to switch languages on the fly, you probably want to use the class-based API instead. Compiled and presented by Vakindu Philliam.
